| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Lab 1: Basic File System](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/courses/cse/labs/lab1.html) | I write it using the whole National Day. Hard but meaningful. |
| [Lab-2: Word Count with MapReduce](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/courses/cse/labs/lab2.html) | It works at last.                                            |
| [Lab 3: Fault-tolerant Key-Value Store with Raft](Lab 3: Fault-tolerant Key-Value Store with Raft) | Snapshot requires a double workload, which I forwent.        |
| [Lab 4: Shard Transactional KVS Service](https://ipads.se.sjtu.edu.cn/courses/cse/labs/lab4.html) | Implement perfectly with correctly handling deadlock and 2PL. |
